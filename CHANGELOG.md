## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Security
- Block SSRF in `WorkflowEngine::actionSendWebhook()` by validating URL scheme and rejecting URLs that resolve to private/reserved IPs (#49)
- Prevent regex injection (ReDoS) in `compareValues()` `matches` operator via `safeRegexMatch()` with pattern validation and a PCRE backtrack limit (#49)
- Enforce strict `in:` validation for `actions.*.type` in `WorkflowController` store/update to prevent arbitrary action type injection (#49)
- Whitelist allowed fields (`subject`, `description`, `ticket_type`, `channel`) in `resolveFieldValue()` default case instead of open `$ticket->{$field}` (#49)
- Apply granular rate limiting: ticket creation `5/min`, chat start `5/min`, chat message `30/min` (#49)
- Add `AuditLog` entries for workflow create/update/delete and report exports (#49)

### Fixed
- Register `Escalated\Laravel\Database\Seeders` namespace in production autoload so `php artisan escalated:install` can run the permission seeder when the package is installed as a dependency (#56)
- Include `url` in attachment serialization (#50)
- Include computed ticket fields in serialization (#51)
- Include chat, context panel, and activity fields in ticket serialization (#52)
