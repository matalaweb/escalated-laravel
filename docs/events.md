## Listening to Events

Register listeners in your `EventServiceProvider`:

```php
use Escalated\Laravel\Events\TicketCreated;

protected $listen = [
    TicketCreated::class => [
        \App\Listeners\NotifySlack::class,
        \App\Listeners\CreateJiraIssue::class,
    ],
];
```

Or use closures:

```php
Event::listen(TicketCreated::class, function ($event) {
    Log::info('New ticket: ' . $event->ticket->reference);
});
```
